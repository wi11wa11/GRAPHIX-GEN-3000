GRAPHIX GEN 3000
Graphix gen 3000 (gg3000) is an interactive generative drawing tool that creates geometric line art. The program has five brushes that can be interacted with to create linear geometric forms, pointilated forms, broken line geometric forms, can be used to create large blocks of colour, and generate forms from past images. gg3000 can be used to quickly generate a large number of graphic images with a wide range of compositions. Busy, dark, and colourful graphics can be created, as well as light, balanced and elegant graphical compositions.
